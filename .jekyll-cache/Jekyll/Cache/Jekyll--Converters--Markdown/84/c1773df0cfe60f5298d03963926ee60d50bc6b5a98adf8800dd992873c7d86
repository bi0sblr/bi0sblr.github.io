<p>The challenge is about bypassing 403 error along with file upload vulneribility and LFI.<br />
When we entered the website there’s a login form and a link to register.
After clicking on register we see a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code> error.</p>

<p><img src="/images/inctfi/403.jpg" alt="error" /></p>

<p>Looking at this, thought we can bypass it which is smuggling the request to get registered. After some googling i found a way to bypass it
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/./register.php?username=ph03n1x&amp;password=ph03n1x</code><br />
Intercepting the request with burp and forwarding it, our registration is successful.</p>

<p>Logging in, we find a file uploader which accepts any file extension. Uploading the file, it removes the uploaded file extension and convert the file name to a hash.
I thought of getting a PHP Shell and uploaded a php file.<br />
After uploading the php, there’s an option to <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> the file. We get a page with following details</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The file has been uploaded to: /var/www/uploads/df0f1a1ac715de9266c8d8391769156a</p>

  <p>To include the file, use ?include=</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we get <code class="highlighter-rouge">LFI</code> at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/../../../var/www/uploads/df0f1a1ac715de9266c8d8391769156a</code>
This <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> option allows only the content of <code class="highlighter-rouge">http (or) https</code>.<br />
The final payload for LFI will be <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/index.php?include=http:/../../../var/www/uploads/df0f1a1ac715de9266c8d8391769156a</code><br />
After getting the shell, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> the files in directory.<br />
The flag is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.php</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Flag: <code class="highlighter-rouge">inctf{REQU357_5MUGG71NG_4ND_1NCLUD3_F0R_TH3_W1N}</code></em></strong></p>
